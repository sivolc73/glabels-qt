### Would you like to build and package gLabels for a particular platform?

* [Let's talk](https://github.com/sivol73/glabels-qt/issues/new).

* Help is needed in building and packaging for
    - Windows
    - Mac
    - Linux (flatpak)
    - Linux (snap)
    - Linux (deb)

* Ideally, such builds can be integrated into the current CMake/CPack build system and automated using a CI service.


### Would you like to donate money?

I would prefer not to take donations at this time. Please donate to another worthwhile organization.

gLabels is a personal project which I work on intermittently, when the itch drives me. I like to walk away occasionally
for extended periods of time. Accepting donations would turn this into an obligation and it would no longer be fun -- at
least that is how I would feel, even if it wasn't necessarily true.
