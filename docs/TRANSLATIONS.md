## Translation management

~~We manage all translations within a [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/glabels/public/). Please don't send your files via Github, use only transifex.~~

Currently you can fork the repository and send a pull request when you complete the translation and I'll be happy to merge it with my QT6 version of gLabels
